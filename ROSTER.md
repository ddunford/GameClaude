# The Studio Roster

The team, as agents. Three leadership **spines** meet in one **Director** (owner-reserved); departments hang off them; **Verify & Judge** gates work out, independent of who built it; **Operate** runs the live game at scale. Solo, these are hats — but the hats never merge build with verify.

**Departments:** `DIR` Direction · `DSN` Design · `ART` Art · `ENG` Engineering · `AUD` Audio · `V&J` Verify & Judge · `OPS` Operate · `PROD` Production & Knowledge.

Every role links its craft depth to a `guides/` guide and runs its process through a `skills/` procedure. Late-activating disciplines note the phase they switch on (schedule: `guides/production-pipeline.md §3.5`); the rest are active from day one.

---
**41 agents authored** — the full studio. The core-loop disciplines are active from day one; the operate-at-scale and late-production roles switch on at the phase the activation schedule sets (`guides/production-pipeline.md §3.5`), authored when their stage arrives.

**Method depth** lives in `guides/` (the per-discipline craft references) and process runs through `skills/` (the callable procedures — `plan-milestone`, `team-execute`, `resume-work`, the QA batteries, `harden-endpoint`, `ingest-asset`, `fab-acquire`, `verify-engine-claim`, `vault-doc-update`, `decide`). Reusable system contracts belong in `modules/` as they are written; `hooks/` enforces guards, injects context, and surfaces progress.
