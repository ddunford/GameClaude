# Guide — The studio SOP (running a milestone end to end)

> **The operating procedure for the whole studio: given a milestone or spec, exactly how it is run to done** — decompose → phases → tasks → per-task test-plan → build → testing → quality gate → review → close — with the owning agent and the method named at every step. `CLAUDE.md` states the doctrine and the phase gates; `guides/workflow.md` is the per-*task* choreography; **this is the milestone-level SOP that sits above both** and the phase×discipline reference the whole studio is measured against. It links the craft guides rather than restating them (one fact, one home).

**How to read this doc.** Part 1 is the headline — the repeatable loop for running any milestone. Part 2 is the inventory of what the studio has to run it with. Part 3 is the reference layer the SOP points into: the discipline map, the per-phase deliverables, the handoff graph, and the activation schedule.

# Part 1 — The SOP: running a milestone to done

Everything below is driven by the **`producer`**, who owns *when and in what order*, dispatches each step to its owner, and keeps the single "you are here" line true. The producer runs the whole loop via **`team-execute`** (the autopilot the constitution names). The one law the loop exists to enforce: **whoever builds a thing never signs it off** (doctrine 1). Every arrow from build to verify crosses to a *different* agent.

## The loop

```

        │   · spike unknowns in isolation — via `spike` — before this closes)
        │

```

## Step by step — owner and method for each

| # | Step | Owner (agent) | Method / skill | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Frame** | `producer` + relevant Director | `plan-milestone` | Milestone restated against `roadmap.md`'s definition of done; owner-reserved calls flagged |
| 2 | **Decompose** | `producer` | `plan-milestone` | `plan/<milestone>.md` — phases and tasks, each with **owner + acceptance criteria + verification link** (doctrine 8) |
| 2a | **Asset breakdown** | `tech-artist` (`art-director` consulted) | `asset-breakdown` | The phase's asset bill-of-materials — every asset by class, each **HAVE / ACQUIRE / GENERATE**, each ACQUIRE with a Fab search line; feeds `fab-acquire` → `ingest-asset` → build |
| — | *Spec-first gate (spatial / systems)* | `level-designer` / `game-designer`; Director approves | `guides/level-design.md`, `guides/game-design.md` | Committed spec (plan/metrics/canonical views) *before* any build (doctrine 2) |
| — | *Tech-design gate (engineering-heavy)* | `technical-director` (+ `backend-engineer` / `network-engineer` on their systems); fresh reviewer approves | `tech-design` | Committed TDD (problem/approach/data model/interfaces/failure modes) *before* build — the engineering equivalent of the spec-first gate (doctrine 2) |
| — | *Spike unknowns* | the discipline agent, reviewed by `creative-director`; `engine-verifier` for engine claims | `spike` (isolated throwaway map, doctrine 3); `verify-engine-claim` for engine behaviour | Proven approach, backported to the vault, before the main build is touched |
| 3 | **Test-plan** | the verifying agent (`qa-visual` / `qa-network` / `qa-functional` / `security-reviewer`) | its own battery, declared up front | Each task's test named *before* build, or `[no-test: <reason>]` — no third option (doctrine 8) |
| 4 | **Build** | the discipline agent (see Part 3.1) | the craft guide + `guides/workflow.md`; tools per `guides/tooling-ue.md` | The work, saved; **serial on the editor** — one editor-mutating agent at a time |
| 4a | **Instrument** *(if it has a behavioural signal)* | `analytics-engineer` | instrument-as-you-build, not a retrofit | The events/metrics the feature's signal needs, wired in the same pass as the build — never bolted on after |
| 5 | **Test** | `qa-visual`, `qa-network`, `qa-functional`, `security-reviewer`, `engine-verifier` — **fresh, never the builder** | multi-view battery · server+2-clients+negative test · spec-match functional battery · exploit enumeration · source check | Defects against the spec, or a clean pass |
| 6 | **Quality gate** | the verify agents | pass/fail against the committed test-plan | *Is it broken / correct / secure?* — a defect is "doesn't match the spec," not an opinion |
| 7 | **Review** | `art-director` / `creative-review` (art, on-pitch) · `code-review` (engineering soundness) — **always a fresh subagent, never the author** | senior craft/creative judgement (`creative-review`); engineering is-it-sound judgement (`code-review`) | *Is it good / is it ours / is it sound?* — standing to say off-pitch, stop |
| 8 | **Close** | `producer` | drain rule (doctrine 6); `process-retro`; `plan/risk-register.md` walk; `knowledge-keeper` for the vault; doctrine 13 for lessons | Every task done/moved/dropped-with-reason · process retro run (`plan/<phase>-retro.md`) · risk register walked row-by-row · vault describes **what was built** · phase file signed off · lessons written into the owning guide · remaining phases re-scoped |

## The inner loop is the whole game

Steps 3–7 repeat **per task** and are the repeatable unit anyone can follow:

1. **The test is declared before the build** (step 3), so "done" is defined before work starts and can't be moved to fit the result.
2. **The builder hands off; it never verifies its own work** (steps 4→5). This is doctrine 1, and it is violated by convenience.
3. **Two different questions, two different gates:** the quality gate (step 6) asks *is it broken/correct*; the review (step 7) asks *is it good*. Both are fresh eyes; neither is the builder. For level work these split further — structural verification (footprints, seating, collision, a full-gravity walk on an unlit level) runs before visual QA (which needs the level lit); see `guides/workflow.md`.
4. **Craft goes through the senior eye before the owner — always.** The owner is never the first competent reviewer of authored look or feel (`guides/workflow.md`).

## Cross-cutting acceptance criteria — design-in now, don't retrofit

Some concerns are **cheap to design in during the current phase and ruinously expensive to bolt on later** — so they are enforced as **per-task acceptance criteria**, not deferred to their full P3 pass. The producer adds the applicable line to a task's acceptance in `plan-milestone`; the verifying agent checks it like any other criterion:

- **Externalize strings** — on *any* task with player-facing text (UI, signage, prompts). No hard-coded display strings; text goes through the localization path from day one (owner `localization`; full pipeline is P3, but the discipline starts at P1).
- **Accessibility basics** — on *any* player-facing surface (a screen, a control scheme, a feedback channel). Remappable input, legible contrast, no colour-only signalling, subtitle-ready (owner `accessibility` for depth; the basics live with `ui-ux-designer` in-screen; full pass is P3).
- **Compliance framing flagged** — on *anything* touching minors, personal data, payments, or the public surface. The task carries a compliance-framing flag so `compliance-advisor` frames the risk *before* it is built, not after (owner-reserved; needs qualified counsel — R7/R8 in `plan/risk-register.md`).

These fire in whatever phase the task lands in. The **full** localization pipeline, accessibility pass, and compliance implementation are scheduled disciplines (§3.5) — these criteria are the cheap-window enforcement that keeps those later passes from becoming retrofits.

## Serial vs parallel

The **editor is single-threaded** — MCP calls run on the game thread and deadlock if concurrent (`guides/tooling-ue.md`). So the producer parallelizes only **read-only** owners (reviews, audits, research) and serializes every editor-mutating step. A task with a visual *and* networked surface goes to `qa-visual` *and* `qa-network`; those read-only passes can run together.

## Decision rights inside the loop

- **Agent-decidable** (reversible + plan-aligned + no spend + no public surface): `technical-director` decides via the `decide` method and logs it to the decisions log.
- **Owner-reserved** (money, public-facing surface, the vision, irreversible): framed by the Director, **decided by the owner**. The loop stops and waits.

## What tracks what — the trackers, no overlap

Outstanding work and truth are tracked in distinct places, each owning one scope; if they overlap they drift, so one fact has one home:

| Tracker | Owns | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| **`TODO.md`** (repo root) | **The live driver** — the flat, ordered, always-current queue of the active phase's work: what's next / in-progress / blocked / done, plus the single "you are here" line. `team-execute` picks the next open item and keeps it current as it works. | Live; drained at phase close |
| **`plan/<phase>.md`** | **Task detail** — each queue item's owner, acceptance criteria, test-plan, and verify/judge owners. The queue links to it; it does not restate the queue's status. | Signed off at close, kept as history. Committed |
| **`plan/game-roadmap.md`** | Milestone/phase status and definitions of done | Durable |
| **`plan/risk-register.md`** | Risks — owner, mitigation, review-gate | Durable; walked every close |
| **`SPEC.md` + `docs/design/`** | The spec — what the game is and the per-phase DoD | Durable |

`TODO.md` is the *queue + status*; the phase file is the *detail*. `team-execute` keeps the two in sync — each TODO item references its phase-file task, and detail is never copied down into the queue. Small debts with no phase task also live in `TODO.md` (its "no other home" section), and survive there across a gate until they land somewhere.

## Close — the drain rule (doctrine 6)

A phase file is signed off **only when every open item in `TODO.md` has a new home**: done · moved to `game-roadmap.md` · consciously dropped *with a reason* (a debt with no phase attachment survives in the `TODO.md` "no other home" section). Then: confirm the vault describes what was **built**, not what was planned; update `game-roadmap.md`; capture every lesson into its owning guide **in the same session** (doctrine 13). "We'll remember" is not one of the options.

**Then two required close sub-steps run before sign-off:**
- **Process retro** (`process-retro`, owner `producer`) — interrogate how the studio *worked* this phase: what in the SOP, a skill, or an agent's method failed, was missing, or slowed the phase down, and feed the fix back into the process the same session. Produces a committed `plan/<phase>-retro.md`. This is distinct from doctrine-13 craft-lesson capture (which fixes the *content* of a craft/engine lesson into its guide); the retro fixes the *process*.
- **Risk register walk** (`plan/risk-register.md`, owner `producer`) — walk **every row** as part of the re-scope: is it retired (mitigated/accepted/gone — say why and close it), still open (carry forward, re-score against what the phase taught), or newly surfaced (add it with an owner, mitigation, and review-gate)? The three 🔴 long-lead rows (R1/R2/R3) are checked first. Never delete a row silently.

**Then, before the next phase opens: the re-scope review.** Every phase-close triggers a mandatory review of all remaining phases in the roadmap (`plan/game-roadmap.md`) — for each, decide **carry forward / rescope / drop**, and rewrite it as current (doctrine 12). A closing phase almost always reshapes a downstream assumption; a downstream forecast is never treated as locked truth, so it is re-scoped against what this phase actually taught *before* any of it is built. This is the discipline that makes decomposing the whole arc up front a living forecast rather than a waterfall (`skills/bootstrap-from-spec`). Only after the drain, the retro, and the risk walk is the phase file marked complete.

## Skills this SOP references

The callable procedures in `.claude/skills/` that this SOP dispatches to, grouped by where they sit in the loop:

- **Orient & plan:** `resume-work` (cold-session pickup) · `bootstrap-from-spec` (standup → phase roadmap) · `plan-milestone` (frame + decompose) · `asset-breakdown` (phase bill-of-materials) · `team-execute` (the producer autopilot).
- **Establish truth before building:** `verify-engine-claim` (`engine-verifier`) · `vault-doc-update` (`knowledge-keeper`) · `tech-design` (engineering-heavy TDD, pre-build) · `spike` (prove an unknown in isolation, backport or discard).
- **Build & acquire:** `fab-acquire` → `ingest-asset` (assets in) · `harden-endpoint` (`security-reviewer`, client-reachable surface) · `activate-discipline` (bring a dormant discipline online at its phase, §3.5).
- **Verify & judge:** `qa-visual` battery · `qa-network` harness · `qa-functional` (spec-match correctness) · `perf-gate` (perf budget, per-task check + P3–P4 hard gate) · `build-validate` (cooked build boots) · `security-reviewer` · `creative-review` (is-it-good, art) · `code-review` (is-it-sound, engineering) · `playtest` (`user-researcher`, "found the fun" signal) · `decide` (`technical-director`, agent-decidable forks).
- **Close & freeze:** `process-retro` (phase process retro → `plan/<phase>-retro.md`) · `content-lock` (Phase-3 content-complete freeze).

Each skill owns its own *how*; this SOP names *when and in what order* it runs. Where a skill is not yet authored (the deferred cross-cutting passes in §3.5), run the method from the owning agent's definition until it is.

# Part 2 — What the studio has to work with

The SOP points at real resources. Here is the inventory.

## Agents — the roster (`ROSTER.md`)

**41 agents authored** — the full leadership spine, the build departments (design, including narrative and creator tooling; art, including character art, animation, concept, VFX and cinematics; engineering, including backend, performance, build/CI and crowd/NPC AI; audio), the builder-independent Verify & Judge layer, Knowledge, and the operate-at-scale disciplines a persistent social world needs (moderation/trust & safety, live-ops, monetization, analytics, localization, accessibility, compliance). Every discipline in the map is staffed. A role activates — goes on the critical path — at the phase the activation schedule (3.5) sets, not the moment it is authored; a role scheduled for a later phase is staffed now and dormant until then. `ROSTER.md` names the roster; Part 3.1 maps each discipline to its phase and status.

## Skills — the callable procedures (`.claude/skills/`)

**Authored and callable.** The SOP dispatches to them at the steps and gates named in Part 1; the full inventory grouped by loop stage is in "Skills this SOP references" above. Each skill owns its *how*; the SOP owns *when and in what order*. The only unwritten ones are the deferred cross-cutting passes scheduled in §3.5 (authored at their activation phase); until then their method lives in the owning agent's definition.

## Modules — reusable system contracts (`.claude/modules/`)

**Not yet scaffolded.** Referenced by the constitution; authored when a system is stable enough to have a fixed "same config in, same result out" contract.

## Tools & plugins — the hands in the editor

Full rules and the which-surface-for-which-job decision live in **`guides/tooling-ue.md`** (mandatory before any editor work). In brief:

- **Our toolkit — `ue-mcp-toolkit`** (the gaps and the reliable, structured operations we own; exact tool names and their behaviour live in `guides/tooling-ue.md`):
  - **`GeometryAuditTools`** — true base transforms from ISM instances (not lying actor bounds), interpenetration sweeps. Catches floating/colliding geometry the eye and naïve bounds miss.
  - **`ContentAuditTools`** — mesh-path audit, dependency-closure measurement, dangling-reference and required-content validation. Catches vendor-path leakage and missing packs before they ship.
  - **`CaptureTools`** — orthographic/perspective viewport captures (`capture_view` / `capture_battery`) for the QA multi-view battery.
  - **`NetworkHarnessTools`** — the PIE multiplayer harness (`begin_session` sets the net-mode CDO and starts server + N clients in one process; asserts pawn state from all parties; `end_session` restores the CDO) that `qa-network` drives.
  - **`BlockoutTools`** — `build_blockout` spawns solid, metric-scale massing from a JSON definition for the spec-matched whitebox; idempotent, exact seating by construction.
  - **`BrowserToolset`** — drives embedded CEF panels; the route to automated Fab acquisition.
- **Epic's MCP toolsets** (~53 registered: `SceneTools`, `ObjectTools`, `BlueprintTools`, `StaticMeshTools`, `MaterialTools`, …) — the standard editor operations Epic covers well. Always confirm a tool via `list_toolsets`/`describe_toolset` before relying on it; qualify names fully (`EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset`).
- **Remote Control** (`localhost:30010`, `py`/console) — arbitrary game-thread Python and console commands, for the long tail Epic's toolsets don't cover.
- **The Fab route** — search Fab and add a **free** pack without leaving the editor, driving the Fab panel's CEF browser via `BrowserToolset` (the `fab-acquire` method). Hands off to asset ingest at `Content/`.

The rule (`guides/tooling-ue.md`): **Unreal's MCP for what it does well · Remote Control for the long tail · our toolkit for the gaps and anything we need reliable and structured.** When a recurring job is fiddly over the raw route, that is the signal to build a toolkit tool for it.

# Part 3 — Reference: the phase × discipline map

The SOP above dispatches to disciplines; this is the map of them — who they are, what each phase needs from them, who feeds whom, and when each activates.

## 3.1 The discipline map

All disciplines a game of this ambition needs, grouped by where they sit in the studio. Every row is **HAVE** — an agent plus its guide/method exists. Staffing is complete; what varies between disciplines is *when* each activates, which is where the activation schedule (3.5) — the phase each role goes on the critical path — takes over. Craft depth lives in the linked guide; this table does not restate it.

### Leadership spine — owner-reserved authority
| Discipline | Owner | Status | Method / guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creative direction | `creative-director` | HAVE | vision · pillars · anti-goals |
| Technical direction | `technical-director` | HAVE | the `decide` method |
| Production | `producer` | HAVE | `guides/workflow.md`, this guide |
| Fused Director call | `director` | HAVE | owner-reserved gate |

### Build — Design
| Discipline | Owner | Status | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Game / systems design | `game-designer` | HAVE | `guides/game-design.md`, `guides/game-feel.md` |
| Level design | `level-designer` | HAVE | `guides/level-design.md` |
| Narrative & worldbuilding | `narrative-designer` | HAVE | `guides/narrative.md` (story-in-play and worldbuilding; onboarding-as-UI stays `ui-ux-designer`'s) |
| UI / UX | `ui-ux-designer` | HAVE | `guides/ui-ux.md` (single owner — logic + visuals; the old split is resolved) |
| In-game UGC / creator tooling | `creator-tools-designer` | HAVE | `guides/creator-tools.md` (**the pitch itself** — the tooling/systems behind the door; the creator-tool *UI* stays `ui-ux-designer`'s) |

### Build — Art
| Discipline | Owner | Status | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Art direction | `art-director` | HAVE | `guides/art-direction.md` |
| Environment art | `environment-artist` | HAVE | `guides/environment-art.md` |
| Lighting | `lighting-artist` | HAVE | `guides/lighting.md` |
| Tech art (ingest/collision/budgets/PCG/materials) | `tech-artist` | HAVE | `guides/tooling-ue.md`, `guides/environment-art.md` |
| Concept art / previz | `concept-artist` | HAVE | `guides/concept-art.md` |
| VFX / Niagara | `vfx-artist` | HAVE | `guides/vfx.md` |
| Character design & character art (MetaHuman/Fab) | `character-artist` | HAVE | `guides/character-art.md` |
| Animation (rig/retarget/Control Rig/IK/state machines) | `animator` | HAVE | `guides/animation.md` |
| Cinematics / Sequencer | `cinematics` | HAVE | `guides/cinematics.md` (owns Sequencer/cameras/cutscenes; `animator` owns montages/emotes) |

### Build — Engineering
| Discipline | Owner | Status | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gameplay engineering | `gameplay-engineer` | HAVE | `guides/game-feel.md`; GAS facts in `guides/unreal-engine.md §3` (a GAS-implementation guide is **to author**) |
| Networking | `network-engineer` | HAVE | `guides/networking.md` |
| Editor-tools programming | `tools-programmer` | HAVE | `guides/tooling-ue.md` |
| Performance / optimization | `performance-engineer` | HAVE | `guides/performance.md` (sets budgets P1, perf gate P3–P4 · 3.5) |
| Build-release / DevOps / cook / packaging / CI | `build-engineer` | HAVE | `guides/build-release.md` (needs a source-built engine · 3.5) |
| Backend / online services (accounts, DB, transactions, matchmaking, save-infra, EOS, server-fleet) | `backend-engineer` | HAVE | `guides/backend-services.md` (**long-lead — architect P1 · 3.5**) |
| Crowd / NPC AI | `ai-engineer` | HAVE | `guides/npc-ai.md` (perceived density: real players first, ambient crowd fills the gaps) |

### Build — Audio
| Discipline | Owner | Status | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audio (SFX, ambience, music, client-side wiring) | `sound-designer` | HAVE | `guides/audio.md` |

### Verify & Judge — builder-independent
| Discipline | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Visual QA | `qa-visual` | HAVE |
| Network QA | `qa-network` | HAVE |
| Creative review ("is it good") | `creative-review` | HAVE |
| Security review (client-endpoint) | `security-reviewer` | HAVE (client-endpoint only) |
| Engine verification | `engine-verifier` | HAVE |
| Functional / gameplay QA | `qa-functional` | HAVE (spec-match correctness — the gap visual/network QA don't cover) |
| Playtesting / user research | `user-researcher` | HAVE (moderated playtests, synthesised into findings) |

### Knowledge & Ops
| Discipline | Owner | Status | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge / design docs | `knowledge-keeper` | HAVE | `guides/design-docs.md` |

### Operate — the live game
| Discipline | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Community / moderation / trust & safety | `trust-safety` | HAVE (**long-lead — policy P1, tooling P2 — 3.5**) |
| Monetization / storefront / payments | `monetization-designer` | HAVE |
| Live-ops | `live-ops` | HAVE |
| Analytics / telemetry | `analytics-engineer` | HAVE |
| Localization | `localization` | HAVE |
| Accessibility | `accessibility` | HAVE (dedicated full-pass owner; `ui-ux-designer` still owns the basics in-screen) |
| Legal / IP / compliance / age-verification / privacy | `compliance-advisor` | HAVE (advisory — frames risk; owner-reserved and needs a qualified human lawyer) |

**Tally:** **41 HAVE** across all 41 discipline rows — every discipline is staffed with an agent and its guide. The open question for any role is never *whether* it is staffed but *when it activates* and goes on the critical path — 3.5.

## 3.2 Per-phase deliverable checklists

Each phase passes its gate only when its deliverables **exist and are committed** (doctrine 2). A gate failure is therefore "deliverable X is missing," not an opinion. Each deliverable names the discipline that produces it; a not-yet-active discipline whose deliverable a phase needs is a blocking dependency the activation schedule (3.5) must have already scheduled.

### Phase 0 — Ideation → gate: **greenlight (owner)**
- `vision.md`: pitch, pillars, anti-goals, audience — `creative-director`.
- Ranked emotional beats / core-loop hypothesis — `game-designer` + `creative-director`.
- Top technical risks & rough feasibility read — `technical-director`.
- `roadmap.md` with each phase's definition of done, and the design vault scaffolded — `producer` + `knowledge-keeper`.
- **The activation schedule (3.5) reviewed and its early-activation calls confirmed by the owner.**
- *Gate:* the owner greenlights the pitch. *(ElseCity is here — Stage 0.)*

### Phase 1 — Preproduction → gate: **vertical slice approved ("found the fun, and it's feasible")**
- Committed spec (plan / metrics / canonical views) for the slice — `level-designer` + `game-designer`.
- A **playable** slice of the core loop in the main build, walked with full gravity (doctrine 5).
- Art-direction bible & look target — `art-director`; both lighting registers — `lighting-artist`; audio bed proven — `sound-designer`.
- Every core unknown spiked in isolation, reviewed, **and backported to the vault** — all builders + `engine-verifier` (doctrine 3, 10).
- One door / zone transition, server-authoritative and hardened — `network-engineer` + `security-reviewer`; proven server + 2 clients — `qa-network`.
- GAS kit skeleton — `gameplay-engineer`; a proven Fab→ingest→place asset pipeline — `tech-artist`.
- Slice passes the multi-view battery (`qa-visual`) and `creative-review`.
- **The "found the fun" signal comes from a moderated `playtest` with real target-audience players** (`user-researcher`) — the qualitative verdict the gate needs; expert review alone is not it.
- **Long-lead groundwork now active (even if not built): backend/online-services architecture decided; moderation/trust&safety policy sketched; UGC creator-tooling concept spiked; string externalization & accessibility principles adopted.**
- *Gate:* Director + owner — the fun is found (via `playtest`) and it is feasible.

### Phase 2 — Production → gate: **alpha (feature-complete)**
- Every core system implemented (not polished); one path playable end-to-end.
- **Backend/online services live** (accounts, save-infra, matchmaking) — *requires the backend discipline active by now.*
- UGC creator tooling functional; economy & progression tuned — `game-designer`.
- Districts blocked out and art-passed; character + animation pipeline delivering; crowd/NPC AI populating the city.
- Analytics/telemetry instrumented; functional/gameplay QA on every feature (`qa-functional`); performance budgets enforced (`perf-gate`, per-task check on hot-path work).
- **From P2 onward, a cooked build must boot** — `build-validate` (`build-engineer`) cooks, packages, and smoke-launches the artifact, and confirms the dedicated server boots and a client connects. A green editor session proves none of this.
- *Gate:* feature-complete — and the milestone build passes `build-validate`.

### Phase 3 — Content-lock → gate: **beta (content-complete)**
- All content in and locked (`content-lock`, owner `producer` with the discipline leads) — the freeze applies to authored content, not the player-UGC stream; after it, only fixes enter the build.
- Full art/lighting/audio pass on every space; cinematics in.
- **Performance within budget on target — the P3–P4 hard `perf-gate`** (`performance-engineer`), measured on a representative source-built target, not a PIE number; build/release pipeline producing cooked, packaged builds on CI, each passing `build-validate`.
- Age-verification & compliance implemented; moderation tooling live; localization underway; accessibility pass.
- Playtesting/user-research feeding back (`playtest`); full client-surface security review.
- *Gate:* content-complete (`content-lock`) — no new authored content after.

### Phase 4 — Ship → gate: **gold (owner)**
- Cook/package/ship pipeline validated (`build-validate`); perf certified on target hardware — the final P3–P4 hard `perf-gate` (`performance-engineer`); server fleet provisioned.
- Store presence & monetization live; legal/IP/privacy sign-off; localization & accessibility complete.
- Live-ops runbooks; day-one moderation staffed; final security + network QA.
- *Gate:* gold — owner.

### Phase 5 — Live → gate: **per live change**
- Live-ops cadence; analytics dashboards watched; ongoing community/moderation; economy monitoring; incident response.
- Every content update runs the **same gated pipeline** (Part 1) — build ≠ verify does not lapse post-launch.
- *Gate:* per change; owner-reserved for anything public-facing, money, or irreversible.

**Reading it:** the art chain (design → layout → dress → light → judge) is the well-worn path the studio already runs. The three ⏳ chains — backend, UGC→moderation, and character→animation→gameplay — are where late activation bites, because each has multiple links and a long lead time.

## 3.4 Load across the phases

Where each discipline switches on and how hard it works across the phases. `on` = ramp-up / groundwork, `PEAK` = heaviest load, `·` = maintenance, blank = not yet active. The point of the table is that a long-lead discipline must be *active before* its PEAK column, not spun up at it.

| Discipline | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Creative / technical direction, production | PEAK | PEAK | · | · | · | · |
| Game & level design | on | PEAK | PEAK | · | | · |
| Art direction / environment / lighting / tech-art | | on | PEAK | PEAK | · | · |
| Gameplay engineering | | on | PEAK | · | · | · |
| Networking | | on | PEAK | · | · | · |
| Audio | | on | on | PEAK | · | · |
| ⏳ Backend / online services | | **on (architect)** | PEAK | · | PEAK | · |
| ⏳ UGC creator tooling | | **on (spike)** | PEAK | · | | · |
| ⏳ Character / animation / cinematics | | on | PEAK | PEAK | · | · |
| ⏳ Crowd / NPC AI | | | PEAK | · | · | · |
| Performance / optimization | | on (budgets) | on | PEAK | PEAK | · |
| Build-release / CI / cook | | on | on | PEAK | PEAK | · |
| Analytics / telemetry | | | on | PEAK | · | PEAK |
| ⏳ Moderation / trust & safety | | **on (policy)** | on (tooling) | PEAK | PEAK | PEAK |
| Monetization / storefront | | | | on | PEAK | PEAK |
| Localization | | on (externalize) | on | PEAK | · | · |
| Accessibility | | on (principles) | on | PEAK | · | · |
| Legal / IP / compliance / age-verify | | on (framing) | on | on | PEAK | · |
| Live-ops / community | | | | on | on | PEAK |

The **bold** cells are the trap: backend, UGC, and moderation each need real work in P1–P2 — before their PEAK — or the PEAK arrives with nothing to build on.

## 3.5 The activation schedule

Every discipline is staffed; each is switched on — put on the critical path — at the phase below. This table sequences every discipline: the phase each role **activates**, and the risk if it activates late. A role scheduled for a later phase is staffed now and dormant until its window. It is a **living decision record** (doctrine 12): the "activates" calls are the recommended defaults and the owner adjusts them — but a role never drops off the schedule silently; it moves only when the owner rewrites its window.

**Every activation runs through the `activate-discipline` on-ramp.** The **Activates** column names *when* a role comes online; `activate-discipline` (triggered by the `producer` on schedule, run by the activating discipline) is *how* — the procedure that brings a dormant discipline into a phases-deep build oriented against the current vault, not re-deriving settled facts cold. It ends with the discipline's first artifact and a registration with the producer.

**Three foundations cannot be spun up at their peak** and are flagged 🔴 long-lead — their heavy build lands later, but their design/architecture must be active in Phase 1:
- **Backend / online-services** — its persistence/account schema shapes the save format and every server-authoritative system.
- **Moderation / trust & safety** — the moderation surface exists the instant UGC ships.
- **Character → animation → gameplay pipeline** — a multi-link chain whose late start cascades into feel-tuning and cinematics. `character-artist`, `animator`, and `cinematics` are staffed; the chain's risk is sequencing (the identity call is upstream of rig, which is upstream of gameplay feel), not staffing.

| Discipline | Snapshot | Activates | Risk if it activates late |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Backend / online services | HAVE | **P1 architect · P2 build** | Save format, economy, and every server-authoritative system are shaped by the persistence/account schema. Retrofitting forces a data migration and re-architecture of systems built on wrong assumptions. *(`plan/risk-register.md` R1)* |
| 🔴 Community / moderation / trust & safety | HAVE | **P1 policy · P2 tooling** | UGC + all-ages + mixed-social creates the moderation surface the instant UGC ships. No tooling = no safe launch; policy retrofitted after content is in is far costlier. *(`plan/risk-register.md` R2)* |
| 🔴 Character / animation / cinematics | HAVE | **P1 spike · P2 build** (cinematics P3) | Heads the rig→anim→gameplay chain; a late start cascades into feel-tuning and blocks cinematics. MetaHuman/Fab shortens lead time but the identity call is upstream. *(`plan/risk-register.md` R3)* |
| In-game UGC / creator tooling | HAVE | **P1 spike · P2 build** | It *is* the pitch ("every door leads somewhere else"). Its data model constrains backend, moderation, and the economy — a late spike risks building systems it can't plug into. |
| Crowd / NPC AI | HAVE | P2 | City density is a pillar; activate past P2 and the city reads empty at alpha. A core-production system, not polish. |
| Performance / optimization | HAVE | P1 budgets · P2 ongoing · P3–P4 hard gate | Perf debt compounds; a late pass on a locked build forces content cuts. |
| Build-release / DevOps / cook / CI | HAVE | P2 | Gates packaged-build validation and the source-built dedicated server (a Launcher build can't link the server target today — on the critical path to real at-scale multiplayer testing). |
| Analytics / telemetry | HAVE | P2 | Instrument before you need the data; retrofitting events post-launch means launch itself is unmeasured. |
| Monetization / storefront / payments | HAVE | P3 build · P4 live | Public-facing + money = owner-reserved; needs legal. Follows content, but store & payment compliance carry their own lead time before gold. |
| Localization | HAVE | P1 externalize · P3 translate | Cheap to design in (externalize strings day one), expensive to retrofit. Infra decision is P1; translation is P3. |
| Accessibility | HAVE | P1 principles · P3 full pass | Design-in, not bolt-on. Retrofitting remapping, subtitles, colourblind-safe palettes after art-lock is costly and partial. |
| Legal / IP / compliance / age-verification / privacy | HAVE | P1 framing · P4 sign-off | Trademark clearance on `else.city` is already outstanding; all-ages + mature-zone gating + UGC + payments each carry compliance load. Late legal review can block ship. |
| Narrative & worldbuilding | HAVE | P1–P2 | Worldbuilding underpins district identity; can run light through Stage 0 but must be active as districts take shape. |
| UI / UX | HAVE (`ui-ux-designer`, single owner) | **P1** | Owned end-to-end as one discipline — logic and visuals together. Splitting UI logic from UI visuals produces incoherent screens (a screen owned by two roles is owned by neither), which is why this stays one owner. |
| Concept art / previz | HAVE | P1 | Feeds art direction & environment art; the look can run on reference boards short-term. |
| VFX / Niagara | HAVE | P2 | Polish-adjacent; the door-transition VFX is the first real need. |
| Functional / gameplay QA | HAVE | P2 | `qa-visual`/`qa-network` don't cover functional gameplay correctness; needed once mechanics multiply. |
| Playtesting / user research | HAVE | P1 | "Found the fun" is a playtest verdict — the slice gate needs real player signal, not only internal review. |

> **One discipline, one owner — never a persona carrying disciplines that fight for its attention.** The art/design specialists are each their own role: `concept-artist`, `vfx-artist`, `character-artist`, `animator`, and `ui-ux-designer` (which owns UI logic *and* visuals as one — see its row). The engineering/ops disciplines — `performance-engineer`, `ai-engineer` (crowd/NPC AI), `build-engineer`, `backend-engineer` — are each a discrete owner, not bundled into one overloaded role. Narrative/worldbuilding is likewise its own owner, `narrative-designer` (its onboarding-as-UI half stays `ui-ux-designer`'s).

### Deferred cross-cutting skills — authored at activation

Four cross-cutting *skills* are scheduled but **deliberately not yet authored** — writing them before their discipline goes on the critical path is premature (the shape of the work is not yet known). Each is authored **at its activation phase**, by its owning discipline, when the phase makes the need concrete. Until then, the cheap-window design-in is enforced by the per-task cross-cutting acceptance criteria (Part 1), and the method lives in the owning agent's definition.

| Deferred skill | Owner | Authored at | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `loc-pipeline` | `localization` | **P3** | Extract → translate → reimport → build; text-fit and pseudo-localization; culturalization review. (P1–P2 externalize-strings acceptance criterion feeds it.) |
| `a11y-pass` | `accessibility` | **P3** | The dedicated accessibility full pass against recognised game-accessibility standards. (P1–P2 accessibility-basics acceptance criterion feeds it.) |
| `asset-optimize` | `performance-engineer` / `tech-artist` | **P2/P3** | LODs, texture/mesh budgets, draw-call and memory reduction on placed content — the optimization pass `perf-gate` measures against. |
| `load-soak` | `performance-engineer` + `backend-engineer` | **P2–P3** | Sustained-load / soak testing of the persistent world at the CCU target on a representative source-built server (R6/R9 in `plan/risk-register.md`). |

## Keeping this SOP honest

This is the `knowledge-keeper`'s standing artifact. When the owner changes an "activates" window, edit the row. When a new discipline need surfaces, add it to the schedule with an owner, an activation phase, and a risk — never left as a silent gap. The status column stays true to the roster: a role is HAVE when its agent and guide exist, and `ROSTER.md` is the source of truth for the roster itself (doctrine 12 — the doc reads as current; git history is the audit trail).
